    <h1><a name="2. GSP Considerations">2. GSP Considerations</a></h1>There are a few things that you do need to be aware of when writing GSPs to be rendered via this plugin.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Link resources must be resolvable</h3><p class="paragraph"/>All links to resources (e.g. images, css) must be <em class="italic">accessible by the application</em> . This is due to the linked resources being accessed by <em class="italic">application</em> and not a browser. Depending on your network config in production, this may require some special consideration.<p class="paragraph"/>The rendering engine resolves all relative links relative to the <code>grails.serverURL</code> config property.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Must be well formed</h3><p class="paragraph"/>The GSP must render to well formed, valid, XHTML. If it does not, a <code>grails.plugin.rendering.document.XmlParseException</code> will be thrown.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Must declare DOCTYPE</h3><p class="paragraph"/>Without a doctype, you are likely to get parse failures due to unresolvable entity references (e.g. <code>&#38;nbsp;</code>). Be sure to declare the XHTML doctype at the start of your GSP like so ...<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>&#60;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC <span class="java&#45;quote">"&#45;//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"</span>
 <span class="java&#45;quote">"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1&#45;strict.dtd"</span>&#62;</pre></div>
